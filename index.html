        Hi! I'm Dhruv, a mechatronics engineering student at the University of Waterloo, and recipient of the Schulich Leader
        Scholarship, the most coveted STEM scholarship in Canada. I am passionate about emerging technologies, the environment,
        and entrepreneurship.

        Currently, I'm working as a Software Developer Intern at Automated Visualization, and as a youth delegate at the Region
        of Durham's Environmental Advisory Committee. In the past, I have participated in a variety of extracurriculars, dabbled
        my foot into social entrepreneurship, conducted bioinformatics research, and ran campaigns for environmental awareness.

        Some of my hobbies including flying (I'm a licensed glider pilot), hiking, and reading books. I'm also a second-degree 
        black belt in Taekwondo and enjoy practicing martial arts. I'm always open to new opportunities and possible internships,
        in the field of software, embedded systems, and robotics so please don't hesitate to reach out to me, I look forward to connecting!
