         Hi, I'm Dhruv, an incoming mechatronics engineering candidate at the University of Waterloo, and 
         recipient of the Schulich Leader Scholarship, the most coveted STEM scholarship in Canada.
         I am passionate about emerging technologies, the environment, and entrepreneurship.

     <p>
         Currently, I'm working as a Software Developer Intern at Automated Visualization, and as a youth delegate
         at the Region of Durham's Environmental Advisory Committee. In the past, I have participated in a variety of
         extracurriculars, dabbled my foot into social entrepreneurship, conducted bioinformatics research, and ran 
         campaigns for environmental awareness.         
     </p>

        Some of my hobbies including flying (I'm a licensed glider pilot), hiking, and reading books. I'm always open to new
        opportunities and possible internships, so please don't hesitate to reach out to me, I look forward to connecting!

     </p>
