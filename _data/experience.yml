- title: University of Waterloo Robotics Team - Firmware Subteam Member
  date: August 2020-Present
  description: The University of Waterloo Robotics Team develops a Mars Rover for the University Rover Challenge (URC) every year. As a firmware 
  subteam member, I help code the embedded systems for the rover using C and C++ on the ARM STM32 microcontroller through the MBED-OS platform.
  I implemented an interrupt-based mechanism for receiving CAN messages through MBED events to reduce the amount of dropped CAN messages.

- title: Software Developer Intern, Automated Visualization (AuVis)
  date: June 2020-December 2020
  description: AuVis is a SaaS startup that develops commercial data visualization dashboards for companies through its Molecule Dashboard. As a Software Engineering intern, 
  I worked with a team of developers to produce an MVP, and continued development beyond that stage. I established data-connection gateways
  between platforms such as Twitter and Linkedin to the application using Python, Flask, and OAuth2.0. I also planned the database schema
  and made SQL queries to aid the transition of the app from GCP to AWS. Finally, I implemented the data encryption using the AWS Key management
  system and introduced best practices for our code repository.

- title: Bioinformatics Research Intern, Foundation of Student Science and Technology (FSST)
  date: February 2019-June 2019
  description: As a research intern at FSST, I used machine learning to find correlations between alcohol consumption and pancreatic cancer
  risk. Training a statistical model, I was able to attain 98% accuracy training the data on a random forest algorithm using Pandas and Scikit-Learn.
  Additionally, I created various plots to represent the data and model using Matplotlib. Ultimately, I developed a research paper representing my findings.
